    <h3>Who is he:</h3>
    <p> Shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinch≈´riki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth 
        ‚Äî a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining  <em>Team Kakashi</em> , 
        Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.
         In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, 
         regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming
          known as the <strong>Hero of the Hidden Leaf</strong></p>
